# Pandora Species API

My first REST API for managing species data from Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora using basic CRUD operations, built with Node.js, Express, mongoose and with MongoDB database integration.

## Wildlife Model Example

  "commonLocation": "Found amongst Crimson Trees biome in the Upper Plains",
  "rareLocation": "Found near riverbanks in the Crimson Trees biome in the Upper Plains",
  "weakSpot": "Breathing Orifice on Chest",
  "drops": ["Arrow Deer Fatty Meat", "Arrow Deer Light Hide"]
}
